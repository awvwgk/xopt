running Xopt
************

``xopt -h`` will give a long list of possible options. The geometry file in XMOL or TMOLE format has to be given
as the first argument

::

  xopt <structure_file> -[options] > xopt.out


**Commandline options are handled successively! Later options will overwrite the earlier ones!**
